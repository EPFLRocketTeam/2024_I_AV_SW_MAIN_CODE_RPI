# This script copies the compiled CasADi and IPOPT libraries from a Raspberry Pi to the local machine.
# It is intended to be run on a local machine after the libraries have been compiled on a Raspberry Pi.
# It assumes that the Raspberry Pi is accessible via SSH and that casadi_arm64 is the directory where the libraries are stored.
# This should be the case if install_casadi.sh was run on the Raspberry Pi.
