# Icarus RPI main code
## Introduction
This is the entry point of the code running on the CM4 of the avionics of project Icarus. It implements task management on a multi-core system running a real-time operating system. The program uses **CPU affinity** to bind tasks (threads) to specific cores and applies **real-time scheduling policies** to assign priorities to each task. It is specifically designed for systems running **Raspberry Pi OS with the PREEMPT_RT patch**, which supports real-time scheduling.

This diagram shows the tasks managed by the main code and their dedicated cpu core.

The aim of this program will be to manage all of the tasks running on the Raspberry Pi.

## Installation
> [!NOTE]  
> This project should obviously be complied and run on a raspberry pi running Linux with the PREEMPT RT patchset. However, it still works to a certain extent on a regular Linux machine like Ubuntu.

### Configuration of the raspberry pi
TODO

### Connect to the raspberry pi
As of the 7.11.2024, the Raspberry Pi 4 of avionics is has this specific configuration:

* WIFI uname: `ert`
* WIFI pwd: `ERT123ert`
* RPI  uname: `ert`
* RPI  pwd: `ERT123ert`

This means that, on startup, the RPI will try to connect to a network named `ert` with the password `ERT123ert`. You can create this network by sharing your phone connection for example.

Then, you can connect to it using ssh:

    ssh ert@pi.local

Here, `ert` is the RPI uname. You will be then be prompted for a password. This is the RPI password, `ERT123ert` in this case. You  should then be connected to the RPI.

Additionally, here is the configuration of Daniel's RPI 3B+

* WIFI uname: `ert`
* WIFI pwd: `ERT123ert`
* RPI  uname: `daniel`
* RPI  pwd: `ert2024`

### Copy files to the raspberry pi
You can easily copy files to the RPI by using `rsync` from your computer:

    rsync * ert@pi.local: --exclude='/.git'

This will copy your current directory to the home directory of the RPI, assuming you are connected to the same network and the pi name is `ert`.

### Requirements
The following packages are required to compile this project:

* `cmake`

You can install them by running these commands:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y cmake

### Compilation
From the main directory of the project, run these commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

## Usage
You need sudo privileges in order to set a scheduling policy to a thread. Don't forget to use sudo!

    sudo ./rocket


## Debugging
The `ps` utility can be use to list running processes.
By default, `ps` only shows proccesses associated with the current user and terminal.
This is not very useful, as it is usually run from another terminal (like a second ssh connexion). In addition, `ps` doesn't show threads and realtime attributes if run without arguments. Therefore, I suggest using the following command:
```
ps -eLo start,pid,user,policy,rtprio,psr,command
```
Explanation:
- `-e` List all running processes
- `-L` Include threads
- `-o` Format according to the format string

Format:
- **start**: time the command started
- **pid**: a number representing the process ID
- **user**: effective user name
- **policy**: scheduling policy ("**TS**": SCHED_OTHER, "**FF**": SCHED_FIFO, "**DLN**": SCHED_DEADLINE, "**-**": not reported, "**?**": unknown)
- **rtprio**: Real-time priority (if applicable)
- **psr**: processor that process is currently assigned to
- **command**: command name

Additional information can be found in the manual: `man ps`  
Finally, to only show our threads, one can pipe the output of `ps` into `grep`:

    ps -eLo start,pid,user,policy,rtprio,psr,command | grep '[r]ocket'

We use brackets to avoid matching the grep program itself.

## CPU Isolation
To paraphrase [the wiki](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/tools/cpu-partitioning/start), the `isolcpus` kernel parameter can be used to specify CPUs to be isolated from the scheduler algorithms. The argument is a CPU core list:

    isolcpus=<cpu number>,â€¦.,<cpu number>

Some other system threads may still be started on the core. See https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/tools/cpu-partitioning/start#cpu_affinity_and_kworkers and https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=228727 for potential solutions. Those could potentially be isolated if needed, but the process may involve recompiling the kernel...

## Possible ameliorations
- Error handling
- Watchdog: logging, stopping unresponsive tasks
- Pre-set stack size and memory
- Test latencies!
- Tune turbo and system cpu limits: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=228727
